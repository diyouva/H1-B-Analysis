## Modeling Post‑Study Work: H‑1B, OPT, and CPT under a USD 100k Filing Fee

**Author:** Diyouva C. Novith (Carnegie Mellon University)

**Summary.** Author merges USCIS H‑1B records (2015–2022) with scraped employer lists for OPT and CPT, and simulates a USD 100,000 H‑1B filing fee. The scenario suggests a ~20% drop in H‑1B applications and compensatory reliance on OPT/CPT. Tech, finance, and consulting lead employer demand.

**Implications.** Tiered H‑1B fees, longer STEM‑OPT, and stronger cap‑exempt pathways can preserve access to global talent while improving policy fairness.
