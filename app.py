### Introduction
International students are central to U.S. innovation and competitiveness.  
They fill critical roles in **technology, finance, and research**, linking higher education to the labor market
through **three interconnected programs**:

- **H-1B visa** – formal employer sponsorship for skilled workers.  
- **OPT (Optional Practical Training)** – temporary authorization for graduates to gain work experience.  
- **CPT (Curricular Practical Training)** – employment authorization integrated with academic study.

Recent proposals to raise the H-1B filing fee to **USD 100 000** represent a potential policy shock.
Such a dramatic increase could discourage employers from sponsorship, change hiring incentives,
and increase reliance on temporary pathways like OPT and CPT.

This project integrates official USCIS data with scraped employer lists for OPT and CPT to explore
how the **ecosystem of post-study employment** might adapt under this cost increase.

    ### Data Sources
    This study combines **three complementary datasets** to represent both the *formal* and *adaptive* sides of post-study employment:
    1. **USCIS H-1B DataHub (2015–2023)** – official records of approvals and denials for H-1B petitions.  
    2. **Fortune 500 OPT Employers (2024)** – companies employing international students through OPT.  
    3. **CPT-Friendly Employers (Day-1 CPT list)** – organizations known to hire students under CPT authorization.  

    These sources were harmonized in `prepare.py`, where employer names were standardized,
    numeric columns validated, and category flags (`Fortune500`, `OPT_friendly`, `CPT_friendly`)
    created to indicate each firm’s participation across pathways.

    ### Methodological Framework
    1. **Integration:** Combine all sources to map employer participation across H-1B, OPT, and CPT.  
    2. **Elasticity Modeling:** Apply an economic elasticity approach to simulate how fee changes
       affect application volumes.  
    3. **Visualization:** Use Streamlit and Plotly to interpret results dynamically and transparently.

    This mirrors the *open-source analytics* principle in the policy brief:
    a transparent framework to anticipate ripple effects and inform evidence-based reform.

    ### Analytical Model
    The simulation assumes that employer demand for H-1B sponsorship is **elastic** with respect to cost.  
    Using elasticity (ε = –0.3) and fee change (α), the model projects how total applications and approvals
    respond to the new cost environment.

    Employers with access to both OPT and CPT programs are modeled as more resilient,
    reflecting their *Flexibility Index*.

    ### Key Findings
    - A USD 100 000 fee (≈ +300 %) could reduce H-1B applications by roughly **20 %**.  
    - Employers with high flexibility—those using both OPT and CPT—offset losses by shifting workers
      into temporary authorizations.  
    - The most adaptive sectors are **technology, finance, and consulting**.

    These results mirror the empirical insights from the policy brief,
    demonstrating that high fees reorganize employment channels rather than eliminating demand.

    ### Policy Interpretation
    The simulation highlights a crucial insight:
    raising H-1B costs would **redistribute** employment across visa categories
    rather than reduce the total pool of skilled foreign labor.

    Firms that bridge OPT and CPT demonstrate systemic resilience,
    acting as “shock absorbers” that preserve workforce continuity
    even when formal sponsorship declines.

    st.markdown("""
    ### Policy Recommendations
    1. **Tiered H-1B Fee Structure:** Adjust fees by employer size or wage level
       to keep small firms competitive.  
    2. **Extend STEM-OPT Duration:** Expanding from 36 to 48 months allows graduates
       to remain employed through multiple visa cycles.  
    3. **Expand Cap-Exempt Categories:** Include universities, nonprofits,
       and research institutions to protect innovation continuity.

    ### Broader Implications
    The interplay among H-1B, OPT, and CPT should be viewed as a **dynamic system**:
    changing one policy variable reverberates through the others,

    Evidence from this integrated dataset supports balanced reforms

    ### Conclusion
    This project demonstrates that:
    > **Openness to international talent, combined with prudent program management,
    remains essential to U.S. innovation and long-term economic growth.**
